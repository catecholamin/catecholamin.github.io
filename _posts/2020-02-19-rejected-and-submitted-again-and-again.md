正是写国自然写的热火朝天的时候，今天收到了杂志社的拒稿信。生信这篇上次被拒后改投MMR，这次过了一个月就收到拒稿信了。
>Thank you for submitting the manuscript. 
>It was evaluated to be of low priority for publication in our journals.  Due to space limitations only high priority manuscripts can be accepted and even scientifically sound work must be refused. 
>We regret that on this occasion we were not able to be of assistance.

看来灌水也不是这么好灌的，赶紧物色杂志再投。

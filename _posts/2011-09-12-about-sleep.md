I read these posts this morning:

I always go to bed until 0:00 or 1:00 or even later. This makes me feel sleepy in the morning and lack of energy. What’s more, the low efficiency is the biggest trouble, which ruin my life.

I decided to change, from now on. It’s 9/12/2011. Sleep earlier, read a half hour English articles on the Economist.com, and go to bed before 23:00.

Hold on.
